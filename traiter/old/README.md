# Move along, nothing to see here.

This stuff is from before I started using spaCy (or Stanza). I suppose I could have used NLTK but the other two libraries had only just started at the time. Only one project still uses this, traiter_vertnet and I don't want to rewrite that monster.

It uses regular expressions on strings to create tokens and then more regular expressions on sequences of tokens to build up traits.
