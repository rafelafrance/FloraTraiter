# The Traits Database Project

The "parsers" directory contains Jupyter notebooks for parsing trait data from various sources. Each notebook parses raw trait data from a particular source.

The "lib" directory contains code extracted from the Jupyper notebooks that may be used in production.

The "schema" directory contains the scripts and notes to build the traits database.
