# The Traits Database Project

The "parsers" directory contains Jupyter notebooks for parsing trait data from various sources. Each notebook parses raw trait data from a particular source. These are raw scripts, look in the "lib" directory for code that is potentially usable.

The "lib" directory contains code extracted from the Jupyper notebooks that may be used in production.

The "schema" directory contains notes and scripts for building a possible traiter database.
